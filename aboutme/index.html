<p>Hello everyone, my name is Sawyer Crawley. I am from Los Angeles, California which is also where I met my wife, Hannah.
    She and I have two beautiful children- Ezra (2) and Lana (2 days). I am very interested in learning more about web development because I think it is an incredibly useful and marketable skill to have.
    When I am not working or doing school related things, I enjoy reading, gardening, and painting. My favorite authors are H. P. Lovecraft and Orsen Welles. 
</p>
<p>I just recently changed my major to software engineering from animal science and so far I have been enjoying this major much more. I took several engineering classes in 
    highschool and they were always my favorite. I feel that web development is a very natural and useful addition to anyone's skillset.
